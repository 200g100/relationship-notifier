# Relationships Notifier [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hellbound1337/relationships-notifier/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hellbound1337/relationships-notifier)

A powercord plugin that notifies you when someone removes you from their friends list or you are banned/kicked from a server.

## Warning: If you get kicked, join back and get kicked again you won't get alerted. I'm not sure how to fix this and i can't really think of a workaround so if you have any ideas please submit a Pull Request
